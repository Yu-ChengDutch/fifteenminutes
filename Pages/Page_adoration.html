        <h1>Before adoration <br>(St. Alphonsus Liguri)</h1>

        <p>My Lord Jesus Christ, who, for the love which Thou bearest to men, remainest night and day in this Sacrament full of compassion and of love, awaiting, calling, and welcoming all who come to visit Thee; I believe that Thou art present in the Sacrament of the Altar; I adore Thee from the abyss of my nothingness, and I thank Thee for all the graces which Thou has bestowed upon me, and in particular for having given me Thyself in this Sacrament, for having given me Thy most holy Mother Mary for my advocate, and for having called me to visit Thee in this church.<br><br>I now salute Thy most loving heart; and this for three ends:<br><br>1) In thanksgiving for this great gift<br>2) To make amends to Thee for all the outrages which Thou receivedst in this Sacrament from all Thine enemenies <br>3) I intend by this visit to adore Thee in all the places on earth in which Thou art the least revered and the most abandoned.<br><br>My Jesus, I love Thee with my whole hear. I grieve for having hitherto so many times offended Thy infinate goodness. I purpose by Thy grace never more to offend Thee for the time to come; and now, miserable and unworthy though I be, I consecrate myself to Thee without reserve; I give Thee and renounce my entire will, my affections, my desires, and all that I possess.<br><br>From henceforward do Thou dispose of me and of all that I have as Thou pleasest. All that I ask of thee and desire is Thy holy love, final perseverance, and the perfect accomplishment of Thy will. <br><br>I recommend to Thee the souls in purgatory; but especially those who had the greatest devotion to the Most Blessed Sacrament and to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary.<br><br>I also recommend to Thee all poor sinners. In fine, my dear Saviour, I unite all my affections with the affections of Thy most loving Heart; and I offer them, thus united, to Thy Eternal Father, and beseech Him in Thy Name to vouchsafe, for Thy love, to accept and grant them.<br><br>Amen</p>

        <h1>Spiritual communion <br>(St. Alphonsus Liguri)</h1>

        <p>My Jesus, I believe that Thou art present in the Blessed Sacrament. I love Thee above all things and I desire Thee in my soul. <br><br>Since I cannot now receive Thee sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. As though Thou wert already there, I embrace Thee and unite myself wholly to Thee; permit not that I should ever be separated from Thee. <br><br>Amen.<p></p>

        <h1>Eucharistic adoration <br>(St. John Henry Newman)</h1>

        <p>I place myself in the presence of Him, in whose Incarnate Presence I am before. I place myself there.<br><br>I adore Thee, O my Saviour, present here as God and man, in soul and body, in true flesh and blood.<br><br>I acknowledge and confess that I kneel before that Sacred Humanity, which was conceived in Mary’s womb and lay in Mary’s bosom; which grew up to man’s estate, and by the Sea of Galilee called the Twelve, wrought miracles, and spoke words of wisdom and peace; which in due season hung on the cross, lay in the tomb, rose from the dead, and now reigns in heaven.<br><br>I praise, and bless, and give myself wholly to Him, Who is the true Bread of my soul, and my everlasting joy. <br><br>Amen.</p>

Who livest and reignest forever and ever. <br><br>Amen.</p>
